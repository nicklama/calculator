# My JavaScript Calculator

## Introduction

For this project, I aim to create a fully functioning calculator by combining all the skills I have learnt so far in HTML, SCSS/CSS and JavaScript. The calculator will support the following operations: [+, -, /, *, =].

## Implementation Breakdown

In order to build a calculator, I will implement the below steps:

1. Create the base HTML elements, including the main output container, buttons and the general layout.
2. Use SCSS styling to add colour, button styling, element sizing and calculator layout using flexbox/grid.
3. Create a JavaScript file to handle the general flow of the calculator.
4. Add DOM manipulation to output calculations to the screen.
5. Utilise event listeners to add functionality and track each button press.
6. Implement functions for some operations such as equals and clear.
7. If time allows, additional operators can be added after completing the MVP.
